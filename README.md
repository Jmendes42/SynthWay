# SynthWay

In this repository I'll be documenting all the experiences and the whole process of building a digital\analog sound synthesizer.

I'll start by experimenting with generating wave forms using the hardware I have available at the moment (Arduino), and an active speaker I've made from Circuit basics (Just added a power socket, a power switch and a an LED).
