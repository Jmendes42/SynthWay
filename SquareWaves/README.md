The easyest wave to produce is by far the square wave, and for that it is the first one to be explored in this experimentation series.

The square wave is an infinite sum of odd waves, but digitaly it can be produced by just turn a signal on and off (5v and 0v respectivelly), to create sudden increases and decreases on the signal.
